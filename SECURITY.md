## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this gem, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/FabienPiette/string_to_number/security/advisories/new) to submit your report. You can also email the maintainer directly at the address listed in the gemspec.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Any potential impact

You should expect an initial response within 7 days. If the vulnerability is accepted, a fix will be released as a patch version and the advisory will be published after the fix is available.
